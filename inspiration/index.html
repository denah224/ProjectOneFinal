            <p class="keone-text"> Keone and Mari Madrid are award winning choreographers that use their dance as a way to tell a story. Some famous artists they've worked with are, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish, BTS, Chainsmokers, Mariah Carey, and many more which also include musicals and films.
                When I was still in highschool, Keone Madrid was a huge inspiration to me, especially since I was apart of my school's dance team. I loved watching how he conveyed not only emotions, but also a story within his dances. I'm not into dancing as much as I was before, but I still enjoy
                seeing his work in my favorite films and music videos. </p>

          </div>
          <p class="uniqlo-text"> Uniqlo is a clothing brand that many people, including myself shop at. Their t-shirts, specifically graphic tees are always simple but unique and had helped me express my own personal style. A lot of their products advocate for charity, such as their 
            "Love for All" collection which supports those affected by discrimination, violence, poverty and many more. It's a brand that I've always loved and will continue to support. </p>

          <p class="susie-text"> I never started doing nails until I saw one of my friends with the prettiest nails ever (they were just painted navy blue) and it inspired me to start doing my own nails. Susie is one of the many nail accounts that I follow. I do my own press on nails at home
            and I've learned so many nail techniques from her. Her nails are always extravagant but no where near messy, despite all the charms she uses on her nails. She is and will continue to be a huge inspiration for me as I contiue my nail adventures. </p>
